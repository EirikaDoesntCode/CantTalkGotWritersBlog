Hey there! <br>
My name is Eirika Doe and welcome to my blog!

I am a Biomedical Engineering student at the University of Hull. While engineering is more so the culmination of expectations I've held for myself than a burning passion I've persued, I still think it's worth sticking to, at least for now.

My previous coding experience is severely limited, editing and creating new Warcraft 3 maps to play with my siblings and attempting to create my own Civilisation V mod, I mainly stuck to pre-established templates, rarely attempting anything brand new. 

Whether this blog will prove fruitful and sprout towards a plentiful repository of my experiences, or die beneath the weight of my growing responsibilities is yet to be seen. <br>
*Stay Tuned For More!*
