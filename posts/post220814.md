Hey, I'm Eirika! <br>
Welcome to first post of my new blog. 

I plan to use this blog to record things I've learnt and tried, whether they are successes or failures, as well as maybe litter a few of my personal thoughts and experiences here and there too. 


## Mouth of the Cave

Following this [guide](https://blog.crimsontome.com/posts/making-your-own-blog/ "Making your own blog") from [CrimsonTome](https://github.com/CrimsonTome "CrimsonTome"), I was able to make this blog despite my lack of knowledge with all things coded. Being entirely fresh-faced I had to download and install various tools and packages to improve my quality of life moving forwards, as well as some things just to get stuff to work. 

While this post and blog itself are pretty bare-bones, I do have ideas for what I want to work towards moving forward:
- Changing the colours and theme of the website
- Adding a more exciting navigation system to the base one
- Getting more familiar with markdown syntax to enhance the flair~
- Pictures???
