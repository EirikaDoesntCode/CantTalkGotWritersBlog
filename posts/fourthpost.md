I've spent so much of my life playing games. Every evening after school I would sit at my computer and waste away the remainder of the day. Crusader Kings, Don't Starve Together, Dota, Heroes of the Storm, Minecraft, Skyrim, Fallout. So many games yet I always played them alone, even when I would play multiplayer I was still alone, no real connection to my teammates or opponents.
