<i>Writing this page has been a struggle for over a week</i>

Finding useful resources can be difficult, weeding out the useless from the boundless pages of the internet is no easy task. So, I took the simple path and asked for direction. Following the advice of [Starbeamrainbowlabs](https://starbeamrainbowlabs.com/) <!-- Link to her page --> I went to [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) <!-- Another link xP --> and began following their planned out lessons and guides. 
<br>
As of the time of writing I still haven't finished any sections yet, but I have worked through the Html section significantly, learning the names and functions of a lot of common elements and their keywords. It also briefly touched upon some basic CSS, changing the colour of the text and background, as well as some different font styles and sizes.
